[S-expressions] [1] (or sexps) are the minimal syntax of Lisp and Scheme. Here
are some tools for parsing and manipulating them in SML.

The code has been tested on SML/NJ v110.69. To generate the lexer and parser
you'll need SML/NJ's language processing tools [2]. On Ubuntu, the required
packages are 'smlnj', 'libsmlnj-smlnj' and 'ml-lpt'. If you're missing the
language processing tools, you can copy the pre-generated lexer and parser from
the 'generated' directory:

  $ cp -r generated/ .

To build:

  $ smlnj
  Standard ML of New Jersey v110.69 [built: Mon Jun  8 14:15:08 2009]
  - CM.make "util.cm";

See the comments in src/syntaxrule.sml for more information on the utilities.
